  <h1>It's a Dice Race to Your Number!</h1>
  <p>A game for two players. Here's how it works. You and your opponent mutually agree on a number that you will both race towards. It is called your goal number. The higher the number, the longer the game. Each player take turns rolling their choice of one dice on each turn. The result of that roll is added to that player's score. Each dice has a different number of sides. For example; the 20 dice has twenty sides, one through twenty, and the 4 dice has four sides, one through four. You get the idea. As you get closer to the goal number, you will probably want to choose a smaller dice. You can choose from the following dice options: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20.
    <br><br>
    <b>Simply enter your choice of dice into the prompt and watch your progress in the console.</b>
    <br><br>
    If you roll a number that takes you higher than your goal number, then... on your next roll, the result of your roll will be subtracted from your score. The game automatically does the math! Adding or subtracting in order to bring you ever closer to your goal number. The first player to land exactly on your mutually agreed goal number is the winner!

  <h3><b>Important Note: Open your console prior to starting the game! You need it to see your progress. Good Luck!</b></h3>
